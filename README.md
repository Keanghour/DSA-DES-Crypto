# DSA-DES-Crypto
DES (Data Encryption Standard) is a symmetric-key block cipher that encrypts 64-bit data blocks using a 56-bit key through substitution and permutation operations.

DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) covers key data structures and algorithms in multiple languages, including arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, sorting, and dynamic programming. Ideal for learning and practice.
